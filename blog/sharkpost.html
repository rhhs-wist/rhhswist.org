  <h1>STEM "Shark Tank"</h1>
  <h3>November 8, 2023</h3>

    <p>We did an activity in which teams came up with ideas for and then pitched a STEM innovation which would then be
      judged and rated by the meeting attendees. The prompt for the activity was to decide on an environmental problem
      and then devise a STEM solution for it. The teams had to work on building connections STEM ideas and creations
      with sustainability. Each team had 10 minutes to research and prepare before getting 1 and a half minutes to
      present. </p>
    <p>The first team, Team Robo, presented an idea to help with combatting the harmful effects of pesticides on plants
      and crops. Their idea was to create a nanorobot that could easily be spread over plants which would then repair
      the plants that had been harmed by pesticides and prevent any future harm from pesticides affecting these plants.
    </p>
    <p>The second team, Team Pretty Princess, focused on addressing the large amounts of litter in the dead portions of
      the ocean. They proposed a robot vacuum that would be dropped into dead areas and use AI to navigate to areas with
      trash in them and suck in the trash. It would then filter out and purify the water and compress and store trash
      which could then be picked up and properly disposed of.</p>
    <p>The third team, Team SS, centered on the loss of biodiversity and the sustainability of habitats. They suggested
      using genetic cloning to increase the populations of the animals that are currently endangered and nearing
      extinction. They would also use genetic cloning to create new species that could survive in the changing
      environments and take the place of species that had already been lost.</p>
    <p>The fourth team, Team SE, concentrated on water pollution, which includes the chemicals, trash, and air pollution
      that affect Earth’s bodies of water. Their proposal was to create a giant water filter that would filter out the
      trash and bad chemicals in the water and properly dispose of them.</p>
    <p>All of the teams were very creative with their solutions and had a fun time collaborating to create the best
      pitch possible. Each of the pitches were very engaging and every speaker got the chance to improve their
      presentational skills. All of the attendees rated each group’s pitches based on their creativity, delivery, and
      adherence to the prompt on a google form, and those with the highest score won gift cards. The meeting was a cross
      between STEM and the business and startup side of the world and the valuable skills that can be applied to both
      fields. </p>
